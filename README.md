# Hackathon APIs

A submissions app where one can see all the hackathons, register for the hackathon and can submit their hackathon submissions


## Context:
The hackathon can be posted by anyone and they will be authorized before they are allowed to post hackathons. Users should be able to come and submit some code or files as hackathon submissions. 


## Application Overview:
* Create hackathons by authorized users only with some basic fields
* Listing of hackathons
* Register to a hackathon
* Make Submissions
* Users will be able to list the hackathons they are enrolled to
* Users will be able to view their submissions in the hackathon they were enrolled in.

## Technologies/Framework/Libraries Used:

### Django
Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. Built by experienced developers, Django takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It is free and open source, has a thriving and active community, great documentation, and many options for free and paid-for support.

#### Why Django?
Django's comprehensive feature set, strong security, and established community make it a popular choice for building complex web applications. FastAPI and Flask, on the other hand, prioritize speed, flexibility, and simplicity. 

### REST API
A REST API is a popular way for systems to expose useful functions and data. REST, which stands for representational state transfer, can be made up of one or more resources that can be accessed at a given URL and returned in various formats, like JSON, images, HTML, and more.

### Django REST Framework
Django REST framework (DRF) is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs. Reasone for using:
* The Web browsable API is a huge usability win.
* Authentication policies including packages for OAuth1a and OAuth2.
* Serialization that supports both ORM and non-ORM data sources.
* Customizable all the way down - just use regular function-based views if you don't need the more powerful features.

### Knox
Knox provides easy to use authentication for Django REST Framework The aim is to allow for common patterns in applications that are REST based, with little extra effort; and to ensure that connections remain secure. 
Knox authentication is token based, similar to the "TokenAuthentication" built in to DRF.

#### Why Knox
* DRF tokens are limited to one per user. This does not facilitate securely signing in from multiple devices, as the token is shared. It also requires all devices to be logged out if a server-side logout is required (i.e. the token is deleted).

* DRF tokens are stored unencrypted in the database. This would allow an attacker unrestricted access to an account with a token if the database were compromised.

* DRF tokens track their creation time, but have no inbuilt mechanism for tokens expiring. Knox tokens can have an expiry configured in the app settings (default is 10 hours.)

### WhiteNoise

With a couple of lines of config WhiteNoise allows your web app to serve its own static files, making it a self-contained unit that can be deployed anywhere without relying on nginx, Amazon S3 or any other external service. (Especially useful on Heroku, OpenShift and other PaaS providers.)

### Validators
Python Data Validation for Humansâ„¢.
Python has all kinds of validation tools, but every one of them requires defining a schema. A simple validation library where validating a simple value does not require defining a form or a schema
